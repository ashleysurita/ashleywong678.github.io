You would think that after having completed a final project, the next one would be easier, not always I say. When an artist has their first released song, yes it was hard work and rewarding when it was released, but the anticipation of the next one and pressure to have a certain standard can bring anxiety. That's what happened to me, the things that I didn't do well in and the mistakes that I had made the first time had become magnified and I was putting a lot of pressure on myself even before I had started any code. Looking back, it was all in my head and I was psyching myself out, luckily there's a lot of support in the learn community and my ED coach was really helpful in guiding me through it. The study groups, the TC's and the overall community really helped with the motivation and confidence that I needed to be less anxious and face it head on once I reached the project section.

I also sat in on a talk by Avi, and he said that something along the lines of being comfortable with being uncomfortable since we're always learning something new and it will always be challenging and uncomfortable. I think hearing that in addition to everything else, everything started to click and I realized I just have to do it and fix mistakes as I go. As my ED coach reminds me "it doesn't have to be perfect".

Building the project and setting up the environment and the db was probably the hardest part. Once I had set up the config file, the enviornment, the data bases, and the modules, the rest became decently routine from the past labs we did since the format was very similar. I had made a few personal tweeks and decided to have certain errors be re-routed differently then another person would do it, but by the time I submitted it, I liked how it routed.

What also helped me the most was staying organized. I had created a map to keep myself focused on the requirements

While I was actually coding it out, I made changes and verifications as needed, but overall this helped me make sure I was doing what I actually wanted to. My overall hope is that it gets easier the more I practice and go along. I'm also hoping to have the time to come back to this project and fix it up as I want and give it more features!
