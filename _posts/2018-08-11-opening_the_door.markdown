Finding the world of coding started with a suggestion by my fiancee, who works in a tech compay. He saw that I was unhappy with my current field of work and had heard from a lot of his coworkers about the growing need for women in tech and a demand for coding. I decided to do some background work, seeing what was out there and different things I might be interested in before committing to a career change (*that's a big road I did not want to just start on a whim!)*. I stumbled across the NYC pipeline programs to promote individuals interested in learning to code. Unfortunately, I was not offered a spot in the program but it did **open the door** for my interest in web design and wasn't going to let that stop me from learning. I tried about 3 different bootcamp prep programs to see what suited me and my learning style as each had different ways of teaching the same material. It was frustrating in the beginning, like learning to speak another language (*because it was!*) and there were a few times I was ready to give up because I didn't know what to do. But with enough stress eating, encouragement, and practice, I started to get some problems correct and being able to follow along. If I have learned anything so far, it is that every problem is not the same and each problem can be solved so many different ways (*there is never a boring line of code*). If not for my fiancee encouraging me to look into it, I may not have started this journey and still may be miserable where I was today.
