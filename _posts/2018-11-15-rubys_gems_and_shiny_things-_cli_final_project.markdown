So I feel I'm nearly done working on my CLI project, it's been about a week since I first got my project idea "approved" by a coach. I didn't realize that we With personal issues I have been going through and the difficulty of creating a project from thin air, I'd have to say I had a really hard time. Without tests to guide what I'm doing and what I should be expecting in the output, I really felt I was coding blind.

My project is to create a CLI that allows the user to interact with the broadway.com website. The user will be able to get a list of all the shows that are active on the website. The user will also be able to get a list of shows based on their genre or select a show and see the show story.

I used 2 classes- a Scraper class to get the information and a Shows class to create and store my shows. Through my CLI, I can call lists of shows based on different criteria and provide more info about the shows.
