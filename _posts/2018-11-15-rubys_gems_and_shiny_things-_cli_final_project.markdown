So I feel I'm nearly done working on my CLI project, it's been about a week since I first got my project idea "approved" by a coach. I didn't realize that we With personal issues I have been going through and the difficulty of creating a project from thin air, I'd have to say I had a really hard time. Without tests to guide what I'm doing and what I should be expecting in the output, I really felt I was coding blind.

My project is to create a CLI that allows the user to interact with the broadway.com website. The user will be able to get a list of all the shows that are active on the website. The user will also be able to get a list of shows based on their genre or select a show and see the show story.

I used 2 classes- a Scraper class to get the information and a Shows class to create and store my shows. Through my CLI, I can call lists of shows based on different criteria and provide more info about the shows.

Making the methods and figuring out how to format what I wanted took a lot of reviewing past labs. A lot of time had passed since I had started the basics and I had started forgetting a lot of small things, like exact notation and things like that. What really stumped me was the scraping with Nokogiri, without the Learn community to help me through it, I would probably still be trying to scrape the data to this day. Once I had the data, separating it was a lot easier to manage. Setting up my Song class was aslo not that difficult, especially after many practice rounds of creating classes and objects, I had found many methods were commonly used (or the concepts were) and got most of my help from past labs. 

The more difficult part was setting up the CLI file: while I was trying to set it up initially, I imagined the code I wish I had (using Avi's words), and that's what I did! After making my initial call methods and supporting methods, I came back to it at another time and added some other starting methods, I had gotten the inspiration from the Scraper lab and I liked the concept.

If I could do it over again, I definately would have made sure to read the entire prompt, I had stopped about halfway before starting the project, and utilize my 4 sessions with a coach (I only used 2). At this time, I didn't have as much open availability as I would have liked since my work schedule is very limiting. But talking it through with a coach and them helping to edit some of the code with me was definately helpful adn a good time for them to steer you in a different or better direction. I also enjoyed having another set of eyes on it before submission, it gave me more confidence in submitting it.
