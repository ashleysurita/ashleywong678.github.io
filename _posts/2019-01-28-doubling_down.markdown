For awhile I have been trying to juggle full-time work and completing the school cirriculum, which at first wasn't so bad, but it got progressively harder. In the beginning of ruby where lessons were not as challenging and quick AAQ solved the answer, the final CLI project and sinatra section proved to need a lot more time and dedication. I was finding myself forgetting a lot of things and confused when I would return to a project a day or two later and having to backtrack which wasn't managing my time well. I was planning on changing to part-time work but I realized how unhappy I was. Luckily I have people that are supportive of me which allowed me the option to decide to quit my job and focus on my career change and school, and looking at it now I feel less stressed and happier that I can dedicate my full attention. Hopefully my sacrafice will pay off but I know I have to make it what I want and keep pushing forward. I made the commitment, so here I go!
